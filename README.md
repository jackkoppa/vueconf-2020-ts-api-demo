API deployed on Heroku [here](https://vueconf-2020-ts-api-demo.herokuapp.com/v2/api-docs) (Swagger docs)

> Note: app runs on Heroku free tier, and so will often be down until an initial hit. If the above link doesn't work initially, try again in a minute, at which point the app will likely have spun up
